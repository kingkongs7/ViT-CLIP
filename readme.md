# Unveiling the Role of ViT-CLIP in Deepfake Detection: A Systematic Analysis and Novel Module Design

This repository contains the implementation of ViT-CLIP for deepfake detection, a model that leverages the power of Vision Transformer (ViT) and CLIP for robust detection of deepfake images. The goal of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of ViT-CLIP in identifying deepfake images by exploring its internal mechanisms and contributing to its performance enhancement through simple yet efficient module designs.
